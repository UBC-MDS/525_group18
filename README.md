# Daily Rainfall Prediction Model

This project models observed daily rainfall data over NSW, Australia. Specifically it employs building and deploying ensemble machine learning models in the cloud, in order to forecast future daily rainfall amount in Australia.


## Data

The rainfall dataset collected from NSW, Australia is quite large (~5 GB). This dataset is also hosted in [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681) and we can use the `figshareAPI` in order to download the data locally.

The features of the data set are outputs from different climate models and the response is the amount of actual rainfall observation.
